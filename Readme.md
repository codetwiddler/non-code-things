# Personal Axioms

## Idealize these things:
* I am brave enough to suck at something new.
* I get stronger/better by doing hard things.
* I am patient and measured.
* I try earnestly to fall in love with every heartbeat.
* I appreciate what I have.
* I get up off my knees and learn to run.
* I am one of the helpers.

## Ask myself these things at least once each day:
* What is one thing I can do today that will make something else easier later?
* What does freedom mean to me, today?

## Remember these things:
* Discipline outclasses motivation. Build good habits instead of hoping they'll happen.
* There will always be someone who legitimately knows more than I will ever know about something.
* Read the documentation!
* It's OK to ask for help!
* Honesty means never wasting mind-space on lies.
* Technology changes daily; I won't try to chase the bleeding edge 'cause I'll lose my mind.
* If I am on the bleeding edge *because I am the one building it* then, I'll stay on that edge!
* I won't be a jerk just because I know something that someone else does not. I was in their shoes once.
* I will not become complacent. If I'm feeling very comfortable, things may not be as safe as they seem.
* I am not trying to be clever. I'm being consistent.
* Not every job is going to be a masterpiece. Nor does it need to be.
* Teach programming to become a better programmer.
* If I want extraordinary results, I need to narrow my focus.
* I do my most important work, my “one important thing” when my willpower is strongest.
* The acquisition of knowledge and information is more important than the acquisition of things.
* Never say "It works on my machine" as though that is meaningful, it is a useless statement on its own.
* Everyone is fighting a battle I know nothing about.
* Learning without application is easy to forget.
* A map is not the actual territory.

## Consider these things when I'm feeling overwhelmed:
* I am not alone.
* I started doing this because I like it, I will not lose that passion!
* Slow down. Focus on understanding how things work, instead of desperately scrambling to get them barely functional.
* Avoidance lets me off the hook in an emotional short-term but doesn’t fix problems. The problems I ignore only compound and get worse. I lean into my problems and chew them up if only a tiny bite at a time.
* life will not be optimal, but I can try to design myself into a better one.
* Sometimes, the grass is greener because it's being fertilized by a river of shit.
* There are no excuses for allowing bitterness.

# Practical Physics

### Entropy dicates: Left to its own devices, life will always become less structured.
Because the universe naturally slides toward disorder, I have to expend energy to create stability, structure, and simplicity. Successful relationships require care and attention. Successful houses require cleaning and maintenance. Successful teams require communication and collaboration. Without effort/energy expenditure in its direction, absolutely everything will inevitably decay.
